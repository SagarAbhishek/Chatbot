Team
We believe in engaging people who are instinctively inclined
                                to support our clients and yet challenge them to superior levels. Our people measure our
                                success by a singular yardstick - the measurable impact of our services to our clients. We
                                strive to build a work-culture where client's success is synonymous with ours.

Impact
In a world where over a billion are malnourished and even more lack
                                clean water, one in
                                five children receives no education and faces significant risks. It's crucial to implement
                                both preventive and remedial measures to address these issues. We must act swiftly to ensure
                                global well-being and sustainability.

Working with Occams was a fantastic experience. They were excellent
                            communicators and came
                            through on all of their promises. I was a little skeptical of at first, as I am sure most people
                            were, but they delivered!

All representatives were very knowledgeable and customer service oriented.
                            I felt they wanted to
                            assist me and insure my needs were met. All my questions and concerns were addressed in a caring
                            and professional manner- Thank you Fidelity and OCCAMS for your support in this effort!!!!!

The company was clear in what they needed from us to get the application
                            submitted, and they
                            handled the rest. They do not get paid until you do.

Did exactly what they said they would do and they got us all this money
                            that we didn’t even know
                            about. Very easy and pleasant experience.

Occams has consistently remained hyper employee focused on learning

                        evolving and supporting

"One of my most memorable moments at Occams Advisory was the
                        realization that I
                        would be working
                        with a corporate company that offered numerous benefits and opportunities for professional
                        growth. It was a moment of excitement and anticipation as I envisioned the possibilities for my
                        career development and personal advancement within the organization.

                        This realization marked a significant turning point in my professional journey, as I recognized
                        the potential for learning, advancement, and long-term stability that Occams Advisory offers. It
                        was a moment filled with hope and optimism for the future, knowing that I had found a company
                        where I could thrive and achieve my career aspirations.

                        Since that moment, I have been grateful for the support, mentorship, and opportunities for
                        growth that Occams Advisory has provided. It has been a fulfilling experience, and I look
                        forward to continuing to learn, evolve, and contribute to the success of the company in the
                        years to come."

"The company's values of maximizing human potential and achievement
                        manifest in
                        my daily work
                        through a consistent emphasis on trustworthiness, reliability, and accountability.

                        Being trustworthy and reliable in the workplace means consistently demonstrating integrity
                        through actions, not just words. I take ownership of my commitments, ensuring that I deliver
                        high-quality work and meet deadlines.

                        Additionally, the company fosters an environment that encourages continuous learning and
                        professional development. This focus on growth enables me to expand my skills and knowledge,
                        which in turn enhances my ability to contribute effectively to the team and the company's
                        success. Collaborating with colleagues across various functions allows us to share expertise,
                        support one another, and collectively drive towards our goals.

                        I have seen firsthand how our values translate into tangible outcomes. For example, in working
                        with the ERC Service, our commitment to client success means we go above and beyond to ensure
                        clients receive the best possible guidance and support. This dedication not only helps our
                        clients achieve their objectives but also reflects the company's broader mission of maximizing
                        human potential and achievement.

                        Through these practices, the values of trustworthiness, reliability, and continuous improvement
                        are woven into the fabric of our daily operations, driving both individual and collective
                        success."
